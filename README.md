# MapsIndoors Showcase Web App
A [MapsIndoors](https://www.mapspeople.com/mapsindoors/) powered showcase app free to use and adapt to your needs.

## Getting Started
Before you begin, make sure your development environment includes Node.js, npm package manager and [Angular CLI globally](https://angular.io/cli#installing-angular-cli).

Using a terminal/shell in the project folder, run the following commands:

* Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

* Run `npm start` for a dev server and then enter a Solution ID in the URL, e.g. http://localhost:4200/demo. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
